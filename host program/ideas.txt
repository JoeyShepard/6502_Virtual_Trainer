to fix:
any time refreshaddresslist appears the others should also
check dblclick of all lists for -1
remove all 'on error
remove other '
more efficient saves so is faster
   how to do this?
   compress -1s
open and save while running
   anything else while running
stop buttons from interferring when executing
remove all the msgboxs
break executing on BRK or STP
take out all debugs so cant hard crash
why is run time sometimes negative
   problem with timer
   maybe use API
also, faster way to draw
   GDI?
   memory buffer
   Is drawing really much slower?
more sophisticated keyboard event
   with shift
dont transfer whole memory when running
List of last 1000 or so cycles and their flags
   could also dump to log
Still duplicating labels!
   somehow left over from last run
Stop writing to text files
Still not jumping right
   top address is EBAC
   jumped to EBD5 and unseen
Shut off UART when closed
LDA #': is not a label
Need some way to separate funtions from labels
   maybe indent
   maybe comment after shows its function
   maybe check for functions only
translate characters like tab to " " for text box
run script sends signal to IDE to reload code
Multiplier peripheral
   need msp430 to help
Rewind feature to see where bad byte was written from
Check box to switch off msgbox after running
A lot of slowdown seems to come from VB
Command to dump registers
Send back timer to see how long was waiting
breakpoints ignored while cycling
checkbox to run file before load (run.bat)
jump to last address after emulation stops
peripheral to input 0-255 with two sliders
.proc could act as functions
post in Code::Blocks about making 6502 file
pro::@lbl in mem manager
maybe looping through bytes to send back might waste time
analyze time spent doing uart and see how to improve
starting to drag sends pause
just send without ack. can ack and resend if necessary later
watch window like 8051 simulator

6502 run over UART
   virtual panel with peripherals
      slider for value? too small
   cause interrupt on button
   text tool?
   buttons and switches can also be set to trigger interupts
   cycle picture
      mouse over to see what signals were
      red LEDs to show current state
      blue LEDs to set states
   button to fetch registers
      could be subroutine or could just be emulated by the msp430
      option to do automatically on break
      gray them out when not current
      would have to be just NMI
   tooltip of section shows name, locked, code, etc
